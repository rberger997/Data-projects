    "People who have attended a \"friendsgiving\" have an average age of 39 while those who haven't are 46 so it does appear to be more common in younger people. Interestingly there is no age difference between people who have or haven't tried to meet up with friends on Thanksgiving night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the average income of people who have attended a \"friendsgiving\" is lower than those who have not (\\$66k vs \\$78k). This income discrepancy could be due to age differences or perhaps suggests that those with lower incomes are less likely to travel to see family and instead celebrate with local friends."
